    <p>&#8220; Wanted to give a shout out Lisa and her awesome coffee. We hopped on board with her at the very beginning of her roasting and have never looked back. She is extremely easy to work with and is super accommodating to any of our roasting needs and the home delivery is an added plus. As long as she is roasting we will keep buying. Thanks Lisa. &#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220; We've been getting regular Cafe Che Che coffee for over 3 months now and have loved every one of our deliveries. Lisa has helped us nurture our coffee obsession and is always interested in getting feedback and helping us find the coffee that fits us best! She thoughtfully chooses all the beans with fair trade practices in mind and was very amenable to delivering our coffee in reusable glass jars! Getting coffee every two weeks has been the delight of our quarantine, work from home life! &#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220; For a household that rarely brews or drinks coffee, it is now our daily manna. We love you and your coffee! &#8221;</p>
