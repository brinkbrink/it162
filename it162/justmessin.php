<h2 class="subheader">A little about me!</h2>
 <div class="whatever">        
<p>Currently a student in the Web Development program at Seattle Central Community College. Previously I spent over 15 years working various positions within the restaurant industry, mostly in the front of the house as a bartender. My love of people, food, and flavors kept me in restaurants but the pandemic combined with a preexisting urge to return to school brought me to this program.</p>
<p>The concentration of my studies hasn't yet been decided but I am very interested in both front-end and back-end development. I've harbored a few passions that inform these interests. Lifelong hobbies like photography, design, and experimenting with different mediums in art motivate my interest in front-end development while my infatuation with logic, puzzles, mathematics, systems, and statistics draw me to back-end development. </p>
<p>Beyond school and work and the aforementioned interests I also love music, foraging, growing food, studying foodways and diasporas, history, social sciences, mycology, promoting community science, and my cats (one of which, Tigre, is featured here in the accompanying photo).</p>
